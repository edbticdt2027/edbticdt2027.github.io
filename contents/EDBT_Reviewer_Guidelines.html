<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">EDBT 2027: Reviewer Guidelines</h2>

<p><b>EDBT 2027 PC Chairs (CfP:  <a href="https://edbticdt2027.github.io/?contents=EDBT_CFP.html">https://edbticdt2027.github.io/?contents=EDBT_CFP.html</a>)</b><br/>
<i>We inherited the SIGMOD 2026 review guideline and edited it to make it EDBT specific. Thanks for an awesome community-maintained doc!</i></p>

<p>Your membership to the EDBT PC is a great and much-appreciated service. A review is intended to serve three purposes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To communicate your thoughts about the paper to the other members of the PC.</li>
  <li>To provide authors with feedback to improve their paper and proceed with their work, regardless of the paper's decision.</li>
  <li>To justify and document the final decisions regarding publication of this version of the paper.</li>
</ol>

<p><u><b>Review Guidelines.</b></u> <span style="color:red;"><b>Write the review you would like to receive for your own submission!</b> Remember that no paper is perfect – one can always find flaws or scope for improvement in any paper. Decide if the paper is an interesting contribution to EDBT or can be made a good contribution after a revision.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Bidding and paper assignments.</b><br/>
      Paper assignments will use a combination of subject area match and bidding.  Please make sure to promptly enter your bids during the bidding period (a few days from abstract submission to full paper submission) and to bid broadly, to ensure you get assigned appropriate submissions.  Once you are notified of your paper assignments, please ensure that no paper on your list falls far out of the scope of your expertise.  If you find that to be the case, please notify the PC chairs immediately and no later than a week after the assignment. <b>We would like to minimize the reviews with “Low Familiarity” confidence, and having such reviews at the end of the review period adds work to everyone.</b> Please also check whether you have a conflict of interest with any author of your assigned papers. In such a case, contact the program chairs immediately.</li>
    <br/>

      <li><b>Paper Types.</b> <br/>
        EDBT 2027 accepts three types of submissions: Research Papers, Experiments & Analysis (E&A) Papers, and Vision Papers. Please read the details from the CfP and familiarize yourself with the requirements and expectations for papers within these subject areas and gear your reviews accordingly.
        Research papers present original contributions in data management and may be submitted as <b>long (12 pages)</b> or <b>short (6 pages)</b> papers.
        <b>E&A papers</b> focus on rigorous experimental evaluation and critical analysis of existing methods, contributing new insights into their strengths and limitations rather than proposing new techniques.
        <b>Vision papers</b> articulate emerging research directions or novel application domains, identifying key challenges and potential impact without requiring concrete research results.</li>
        <br/>

      <li><b>Accept vs. Revision vs. Rejection.</b> <br/>
        When a paper is exceptionally strong and raises no substantive concerns or opportunities for improvement, it can be recommended for acceptance immediately. Otherwise, it could be revised or rejected. For all submission rounds, the time between notification and submission of revisions is about one month. Please consider this timeline when making your requests for revisions based on the requested revision items. Moreover, ask only for revision items/changes that you consider necessary for the paper to be accepted. Please do not list revisions that, while they may make a paper stronger, may not be strictly required for acceptance. Please do not allow your own estimate of the amount of time required for a set of revisions to impact the final paper decision.<br/><br/>

        On the other hand, <b>if the revision items are not “deterministic”, a rejection may be the right recommendation</b> (doing additional experiments may be doable in a revision, adding a better motivating example may be doable in a revision, BUT proving additional theoretical results or changing the model may not be doable in a revision). Remember that it may be frustrating for the authors to have a paper rejected after a revision.<br/><br/>

        <b>The final decision of a paper (after revision) needs to be rooted in the initial reviews and revision requests. You should only reject a paper if one of the requested changes in the revision item was not implemented in a satisfying manner.</b></li><br/>

    <li><b>Review constructively, neutrally, professionally, and with an open mind.</b><br/>
      Aim for detailed reviews based on facts rather than personal opinions.  Avoid generic statements; instead, ask for specific experiments, refer to specific related work rather than hinting at some body of work, and be specific about the parts you found confusing and why.  Use professional language and report any diversity and inclusion issues with regard to examples and writing. A review is not about the question of whether you would have written the paper differently if you had submitted the paper. There are different ways/styles of writing papers and explaining ideas. The question is whether the paper is a valid contribution and whether the proposed techniques are interesting/novel additions to the community’s body of knowledge. Novelty is not just radically new solutions but also new problems, implementations, evaluations (experiments and user study), and impact or potential for impact. Finally, look for reasons to accept a paper.  No paper will be perfect; carefully consider whether the identified criticisms should amount to rejection.</li>
    <br/>

    <li><b>PLEASE be responsive and adhere to the timeline.</b> <br/>
      Submit your reviews on time, heed AE requests to revise or strengthen your reviews, and <b>participate in reviewer discussions</b>. There is a brief author feedback phase during which authors may <b>only clarify</b> potential misunderstandings in the initial reviews.<br/>

      There are two discussion phases. The first takes place after initial reviews are submitted and before decisions are made to accept, revise, or reject a paper. The second occurs after the second round of reviews for papers recommended for revision. These discussions are critical for ensuring consistent and coherent decisions across all submissions. <b>If you like a paper, argue for it, and do not merely go by others’ opinions, and make sure you consider and acknowledge authors’ feedback in your evaluations.</b></li>
      <br/>

    <li><b>Code availability</b><br/>
    Authors must submit supplemental material, such as code, data, and other implementation artifacts used to produce the results reported in the paper. Reviewers should consider it in their evaluation of the scientific quality of the contribution. If the authors cannot submit supplemental material, this must be justified by the authors during submission (e.g., industrial research, etc.).</li><br/>

    <li><b>Single-anonymity</b><br/>
    EDBT employs single-anonymous reviewing, which requires authors to include their names and affiliations as part of their submission. Reviewers, on the other hand, are anonymous to the authors.</li><br/>

    <li><b>Inclusive language</b><br/>
    In keeping with EDBT's efforts on Diversity and Inclusion in our conference and community, please check the paper for language. Please read this article if you have not already done so: <a href="https://edbticdt2027.github.io/?contents=DEI_in_writing.html">https://edbticdt2027.github.io/?contents=DEI_in_writing.html</a>
    If you find exclusionary or hurtful language or examples (even if unintentional), point them out in your review and suggest how the authors can improve the text.</li><br/>

    <li><b>External reviewers</b><br/>
    As a PC member, we expect you to review the papers yourself. <b>Involving an external reviewer should be the rare exception and only with prior permissions from the AEs and chairs. <span style="color:red;">Do not share the papers you are reviewing with your students and postdocs without prior permission.</span></b></li><br/>

    <li><b>On using Generative AI / LLMs for reviews.</b><br/>
    The use of GenAI tools usually violates the confidentiality of the review process. Furthermore, reviews generated by GenAI tools do not serve the purpose of paper reviewing for publications at conferences. Thus,
        <ul>
          <li><b>Reviewers <span style="color:red;">must not</span> upload submissions into GenAI tools.</b></li>
          <li><b>Reviewers <span style="color:red;">must not upload</span> their reviews to GenAI tools to edit them, make them better, more positive, etc.</b></li>
          <li><b>Reviewers <span style="color:red;">must not</span> use these tools to generate superficial negative/ positive reviews.</b></li>
          <li>Reviewers <b><span style="color:green;">may apply</span> GAI tools to publicly available information</b>. For example, to generate summaries of publicly available research papers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br/>
    <li><b>Shepherding</b><br/>
      A small number of EDBT papers could be recommended as Accept with shepherding post revision. By default, it is the responsibility of the AE to serve as the shepherd.
    </li>
