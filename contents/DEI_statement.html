<p>EDBT/ICDT 2027 continues to participate in the DB <a href="https://dbdni.github.io/">Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)</a> initiative, which aims to guide researchers in our community to adopt a more inclusive mindset in general toward different individuals regardless of their age, biological sex, gender identity, race, cultural background, religion, physical and mental ability, sexual orientation, parental and marital status, etc. During our conference, the initiative introduces several efforts to be more inclusive and equitable. Such efforts include providing an option for disability and special needs during registration and the necessary follow-up after registration, facilitating parenting support and childcare, organizing a mentorship lunch to foster interactions between senior and junior researchers, collecting and presenting examples of discriminatory behavior and language to raise awareness, encouraging events focused on DEIand featuring members of underrepresented groups (e.g., women, gender minorities, people of color, Indigenous people, members of the LGBTQ+ community, individuals with disabilities, or people from the Global South), and gathering feedback from attendees.</p>
