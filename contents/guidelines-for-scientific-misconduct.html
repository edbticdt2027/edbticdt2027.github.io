<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Guidelines for Scientific Misconduct</h2>

In general, we base our definitions and policies on <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/general-information/publication-policies">the policies</a> for the Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment (PVLDB). For details on the individual policies, please refer to them.

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Plagiarism</h3></b>

Respecting intellectual property rights is a foundational principle of the PVLDB’s Codes of Ethics for Authors. Plagiarism, in which one misrepresents ideas, words, computer codes, or other creative expressions as one's own, is a clear violation of such ethical principles. Plagiarism can also represent a violation of copyright law, punishable by statute.

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Author misrepresentation</h3></b>

Author misrepresentation occurs when an author of a work inappropriately credits the authors of that Work. One form of author misrepresentation is the listing of authors who did not participate in a meaningful way in the preparation of the Work. Another form of misrepresentation would be omitting the names of authors who did participate in a meaningful way in the creation of the Work without their knowledge and/or against their will.

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Conflicts of Interest</h3></b>

A conflict of interest between a PC member and an author occurs when:

<p>
    <ul>
    <li> The PC member is a co-author of the paper. </li>
    <li> The PC member has been a co-worker in the same organization within the past 5 years or will be doing so in the next 6 months on account of an accepted job offer. </li>
    <li> The PC member has been a collaborator or coauthor within the past 5 years.</li>
    <li> The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
    <li> The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
    <li> The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author. </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Content falsification and/or fabrication</h3></b>

Content falsification is any form of intentional misrepresentation of results, supporting materials, or references. Content fabrication is fabricating data or results.

<b><h3 style="color: black;"></b>Usage of generative AI / LLMs / Chatbots</h3></b>

This policy is based on ACM’s [policy on authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship).
Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc. If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section.
Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations are to be considered exceptions to this disclosure requirement and are generally permitted and need not be disclosed.

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Author/Reviewer Collusion</h3></b>

Author/Reviewer collusion occurs when authors or reviewers act to change or influence the result of the review process of a given paper. Non-exhaustive examples of collusion involve:
    • Disseminating submission details to some reviewers
    • Reciprocating to reviewers who contacted the author related to his/her submission
    • Seeking confidential information related to the review process
    • Trying to influence the review process of his/her submission (e.g., providing materials for the discussions, writing reviews on behalf of a reviewer, impersonating the reviewer or meta-reviewer, coercing a reviewer to be favorable, offering financial or professional incentives to a reviewer as quid pro quo) for a favorable outcome
    • Over- or underspecifying conflicts of interest
Authors must make sure to disclose all Conflicts of Interest (CoI) when submitting a paper to EDBT. COIs should be declared even in cases of ongoing collaborations that have not yet resulted in a published artifact at the time of the EDBT submission. Failing to do so will incur penalties related to Author/Reviewer collusion when the unnotified collaboration becomes public.

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Resubmission</h3></b>

A paper submitted to any of the rounds and rejected cannot be re-submitted to any of the two subsequent rounds across conferences. For example, a paper that was submitted to Round 2 and rejected can only be resubmitted to Round 2 of EDBT of the subsequent year.

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Penalties</h3></b>

Usually, any scientific misconduct leads to the rejection of a submission or the retraction of an already published paper and disinvitation to present the work at the conference. In cases of significant or repeated misconduct, the EDBT Executive Board can issue a one-year or multi-year ban on the authors of submissions to EDBT or from any other role in EDBT’s activities.
Investigations into potential misconduct will be done with utmost care and diligence. Authors will have the opportunity to appeal the decision to the EDBT Executive Board.
