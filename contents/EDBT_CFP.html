<b><h3 style="color: black;">Paper Types</h3></b>
<p>
<b>New</b>: EDBT limits submissions to <b>three papers per author</b> and submission cycle, for up to nine papers per year.
</p>

<p>
The conference invites the submission of regular Research papers (long or short), Experiment & Analysis papers, and Vision papers. All papers are reviewed by the EDBT program committee
</p>

<p>
  <b>Research papers</b> present original contributions related to all aspects of data management. The submissions can be <b>long (12p) or short (6p)</b>. Titles of short paper submissions must start with the phrase "[Short Paper]".

</p>

<p>
  <b>Experiments & Analysis (E&A)</b> submissions focus on a comprehensive and detailed performance evaluation, on methodology, and on an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of ideas published in previous work. The scientific contribution of an E&A paper lies in providing new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods rather than in providing new methods. Papers proposing new solutions should be submitted to the regular research track. <b>Titles of E&A paper submissions must start with the phrase "[Experiments & Analysis]".
</b>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Vision</b> submissions describe emerging areas of research or new applications of data management technology. Papers in this track are not required to present research results. Rather, they may articulate a vision for future research in an important new area, identify challenging technical problems to be addressed, and explain potential technical or social impact. <b>Titles of Vision paper submissions must start with the phrase "[Vision Paper]"</b>. They are limited to 6 pages.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Authorship and Conflicts of interest (COI)</h3></b>
<p>
All authors must be registered on the CMT site and provide an ORCID. All authors take full responsibility for the content of the paper. The list of authors in CMT must be identical to the list of authors noted on the pdf file.
</p>

<p>
During the submission of a paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper's authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only the PC members with whom they have a conflict of interest (COI), as defined below.
<ul>
  <li>The PC member is a co-author of the paper.</li>
  <li>The PC member has been a co-worker in the same organization within the past 5 years or will be doing so in the next 6 months on account of an accepted job offer.</li>
  <li>The PC member has been a collaborator or coauthor within the past 5 years.</li>
  <li>The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
  <li>The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
  <li>The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Papers with incorrect or incomplete authorship and conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection. To identify any potentially spurious conflicts, PC members will be given a list of submitting authors who have indicated that they have a conflict with that PC member.
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Duplicate Submissions and Novelty Requirements</h3></b>
<p>
A paper submitted to EDBT cannot be under review at any other publishing forum or presentation venue - including conferences, workshops, and journals - during the entire period when the paper is being considered for EDBT. Furthermore, after a paper is submitted to EDBT, the authors must await the response and only then resubmit elsewhere if the paper is rejected (or withdrawn at their request) from EDBT.
</p>

<p>
All papers submitted to EDBT must present substantial new content not described in any prior publication. A prior publication is either (a) a paper of five pages or more presented, or accepted for presentation, at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or (b) an article published, or accepted for publication, in a refereed journal. If an EDBT submission overlaps with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication and clearly explain the relationship between the two.
</p>

<p>
A paper submitted to any of the rounds and rejected cannot be re-submitted to any of the two subsequent rounds across conferences. For example, a paper that was submitted to Round 2 and rejected can only be resubmitted to Round 2 of EDBT of the subsequent year.
</p>

<p>
Any violation of the duplicate submission and novelty requirements will result in an immediate rejection of the submitted paper.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Formatting and Submission Guidelines</h3></b>

<p>All submissions will be electronic via CMT at <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EDBT2027" target="_blank">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EDBT2027</a>. The submission site will be available from December 15, 2025.</p>

<p>All authors are required to register themselves into CMT. We expect authors to have a single unique ORCID, they are required to declare at the time of submission. We also encourage authors to inform their DBLP ID. This can be done according to the guidelines here: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/docs/help/general/external-profile.html" target="_blank">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/docs/help/general/external-profile.html</a>. Both IDs will be used to check for COIs.</p>

<p>Conflicts of interest can be declared on CMT by clicking on your name (upper-right-hand-side on CMT) and selecting "Domain Conflict" and "Individual Conflicts". An author's declared conflicts will be automatically applied to all of their submissions (conflicts are not declared per submission).</p>

<p>
	Papers should be formatted according to the latest ACM Proceedings Format without any change in terms of fonts, margins, inter-column spacing, style, footers, and so on. All manuscripts should be formatted according to the double-column ACM SIG conference proceedings format.

	<ul>
		<li>The authors who are in need of a LaTeX/Word template can refer to the following link:<br><a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>.</li>
		<li>Overleaf authors can refer to the following link:<br><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template" target="_blank">https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template</a>. </li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
Regular Research papers and Experiments & Analysis papers must be at most 12 pages long, with additional unlimited pages for references only. Short research papers and Vision papers must be at most 6 pages long, with additional unlimited pages for references only. All content, including any appendices but excluding the references, must fit on the given number of pages.
</p>

<p>
Each research paper is to be submitted as a single PDF file. Submitted papers must print without difficulty on a variety of printers using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submitted PDF file prints easily on simple default configurations.
</p>

<p>EDBT employs single-anonymous reviewing, which requires authors to include their names and affiliations as part of their submission. Reviewers, on the other hand, are anonymous to the authors.</p>

<p>Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be desk-rejected.</p>

<p>Once the paper is submitted, EDBT does not accept any changes to the title and/or authorship list, except in rare cases where authors must comply with revision requests or wish to acknowledge the work performed to revise a paper according to the reviewers' requests. If such a change is warranted, it must be made on the submission site, and the PC chairs must be informed through CMT before the revised manuscript is submitted.</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Artifact Availability</h3></b>
<p>
Authors must submit supplemental material, such as code, data, and other implementation artifacts used to produce the results reported in the paper. Reviewers will have access to the supplemental material and consider it in their evaluation of the scientific quality of the contribution. If the authors cannot submit supplemental material, this must be documented by the authors during the submission process (e.g., industrial research, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Authors can submit (a) a single zip file as supplemental material or (b) include a link to the supplemental material (e.g., a link to a GitHub repository). Links are only allowed when there is no access-monitoring to the webpage, to preserve the anonymity of the reviewers.
</p>

<p>
<b>The text of the paper must have a section named Artifacts</b> right before the references, which provides an explanation on access and use of all the artifacts for that paper. If no artifacts are available, the author should provide an explanation in that section. This section does not count towards the submission page limit. E&A papers are required to provide artifacts.
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Inclusion and Diversity in Writing and Presentation</h3></b>
<p>
Authors are strongly encouraged to be inclusive in the writing and presentation of their work.</p>
<p>
Please visit the webpage <a href="?contents=DEI_in_writing.html" target="_blank">Inclusion and Diversity in Writing and Presentations</a> for details.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Important dates</h3></b>

<p>
EDBT 2027 will have three annual research paper submission rounds. Each author is limited to three (3) submissions per round. Each round includes an opportunity to submit a revision if the paper receives a 'revise' decision upon the first review phase. The final decision for papers that receive a 'revise' will be reached after a second phase of reviews within the corresponding submission round. All times are 5pm PST.
</p>

<p>Papers accepted during all three submission rounds will be presented at EDBT 2027.</p>
