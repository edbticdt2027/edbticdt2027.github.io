<b><h3 style="color: black;">Paper Types</h3></b>
<p>
The conference invites the submission of regular Research papers (long or short), Experiment & Analysis papers and Vision papers. All papers are reviewed by the EDBT program committee.
</p>

<p>
<b>Research papers</b> present original contributions related to all aspects of data management. The submissions can be <b>long or short</b>. <b>Titles of Short papers must start with the phrase "[Short Paper]"</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Experiments & Analysis (E&A)</b> submissions focus on a comprehensive and detailed performance evaluation, on methodology, and on an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of ideas published in previous work. The scientific contribution of an E&A paper lies in providing new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods rather than in providing new methods. Papers proposing new solutions should be submitted to the regular research track. <b>Titles of E&A papers must start with the phrase "[Experiments & Analysis]"</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Vision</b> submissions describe emerging areas of research or new applications of data management technology. Papers in this track are not required to present research results. Rather, they may articulate a vision for future research in an important new area, identify challenging technical problems to be addressed, and explain potential technical or social impact.  <b>Titles of Vision papers must start with the phrase "[Vision Paper]"</b>.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Conflicts of interest (COI)</h3></b>
<p>
During the submission of a paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper's authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only the PC members with whom they have a conflict of interest (COI), as defined below.
</p>

<p>
A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when, and only when, one or several of the following conditions hold:
<ul>
 <li>The PC member is a co-author of the paper</li>
 <li>The PC member has been a co-worker in the same organization within the past ten years</li>
 <li>The PC member has been a collaborator within the past ten years</li>
 <li>The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago</li>
 <li>The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago</li>
 <li>The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.
</p>

<p>
To identify any potentially spurious conflicts, PC members will be given a list of submitting authors who have indicated that they have a conflict with that PC member.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Duplicate Submissions and Novelty Requirements</h3></b>
<p>
A paper submitted to EDBT cannot be under review at any other publishing forum or presentation venue -- including conferences, workshops, and journals -- during the entire period when the paper is being considered for EDBT. Furthermore, after a paper is submitted to EDBT, the authors must await the response and only then resubmit elsewhere if the paper is rejected (or withdrawn at their request) from EDBT.
</p>

<p>
All papers submitted to EDBT must present substantial new content not described in any prior publication. A prior publication is either (a) a paper of five pages or more presented, or accepted for presentation, at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or (b) an article published, or accepted for publication, in a refereed journal. If an EDBT submission overlaps with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication and clearly explain the relationship with that prior publication.
</p>

<p>
A paper submitted to one of the first two EDBT 2026 rounds (see important dates below) cannot be submitted to any of the subsequent rounds of EDBT 2026. Furthermore, papers submitted to the third round of EDBT 2025 cannot be submitted to the first EDBT 2026 round.
</p>

<p>
Any violation of the duplicate submission and novelty requirements will result in an immediate rejection of the submitted paper.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Formatting and Submission Guidelines</h3></b>

<p>All submissions will be electronic via CMT at <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EDBT2026" target="_blank">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EDBT2026</a>. The submission site will be available from December 15, 2024.</p>

<p>All authors are required to register themselves into CMT. We expect authors to have a single unique ORCID, they are required to declare at the time of submission. We also encourage authors to inform their DBLP ID. This can be done according to the guidelines here: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/docs/help/general/external-profile.html" target="_blank">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/docs/help/general/external-profile.html</a>. Both IDs will be used to check for COIs.</p>

<p>Conflict of interest can be declared on CMT by clicking on your name (upper-right-hand-side on CMT) and selecting "Domain Conflict" and "Individual Conflicts". An author's declared conflicts will be automatically applied to all of their submissions (conflicts are not declared per submission).</p>

<p>
	Papers should be formatted according to the latest ACM Proceedings Format without any change in terms of fonts, margins, inter-column spacing, style, footers, and so on. All manuscripts should be formatted according to the double-column ACM SIG conference proceedings format.

	<ul>
		<li>The authors who are in need of a LaTeX/Word template can refer to the following link:<br><a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>.</li>
		<li>Overleaf authors can refer to the following link:<br><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template" target="_blank">https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template</a>. </li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
Regular research papers and Experiments & Analysis papers must be at most 12 pages long, with additional unlimited pages for references. Short research papers and Vision papers must be at most 6 pages long, with additional unlimited pages for references.
</p>

<p>
Each research paper is to be submitted as a single PDF file. Submitted papers must print without difficulty on a variety of printers using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submitted PDF file prints easily on simple default configurations.
</p>

<p>EDBT uses non-anonymous submissions, which means that the authors
must list their names and affiliations as part of their submission.
Reviewers, on the other hand, are anonymous to the authors.</p>

<p>Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be desk rejected.</p>

<p>Once the paper is submitted, EDBT does not accept any changes in the title and/or authorship list, with the rare exception of authors having to comply with the revision requests and to acknowledge the work that someone has put in to revise a paper according to what the reviewers have requested. If such a change is warranted, the change has to be made on the submission site, and the PC chairs have to be informed through CMT, before the submission of the revised manuscript.</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Artifact Availability</h3></b>
<p>
Authors must submit supplemental material, such as code, data, and other implementation artifacts used to produce the results reported in the paper. Reviewers will have access to the supplemental material and consider it in their evaluation of the scientific quality of the contribution. Any exception has to be documented by the authors during the submission process (e.g., industrial research, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Authors can submit (a) a single zip file as supplemental material or (b) include a link to the supplemental material (e.g., a link to a GitHub repository). Links are only allowed when there is no access monitoring to the webpage, to preserve the anonymity of the reviewers.
</p>

<p>
<b>The text of the paper must have a section named Artifacts</b> right before the references, that provides explanation on access and use of all the artifacts for that paper. If no artifacts are available, the author should provide an explanation on that section. This section does not count on the submission page limit.
</p>

<b><h3 style="color: black;">Inclusion and Diversity in Writing and Presentation</h3></b>
<p>
Authors are strongly encouraged to be inclusive in the writing and presentation of their work.</p>
<p>
Please visit the webpage <a href="?contents=DEI_in_writing.html" target="_blank">Inclusion and Diversity in Writing and Presentations</a> for details.
</p>


<b><h3 style="color: black;">Important dates</h3></b>

<p>
EDBT 2026 will have three annual research paper submission rounds. Each round includes an opportunity to submit a revision if the paper receives a 'revise' decision upon the first review phase. The final decision for papers that receive a 'revise' will be reached after a second phase of reviews inside the corresponding submission round.
